House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
📌 Project Overview
This repository implements a simple Linear Regression model to predict house sale prices based on a subset of features from the Kaggle House Prices dataset.
The project covers:

Data loading & preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Model training
Model evaluation
Visualization of results
📊 Dataset
Source: Housing.csv from Kaggle’s House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition
Sample Size: 546 observations in Housing.csv
🧮 Features Selected
⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:

Feature Column	Description
bathrooms	Number of bathrooms 
area	Above grade (ground) total area (sq ft)
airconditioning  	 Number of airconditioner
stories
prefarea    total preffered area (sq ft)
parking    parking area 
basement    
furnishingstatus    furnitures placed in the rooms
hotwaterheating    geysers placed in the bathroom
mainroad    how much nearest house from the main-road 
guestroom   how much bigger & well decorated guestroom
bedrooms    Number of bedrooms 
🛠 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Loading
Imported train.csv using pandas.
2️⃣ Preprocessing
Selected only the columns of interest (GrLivArea, BedroomAbvGr, FullBath, SalePrice).
Renamed columns for readability.
Checked for missing values and calculated basic statistics.
3️⃣ Data Splitting & Scaling
Split dataset into training (90%) and testing (10%) sets using train_test_split.
Applied StandardScaler to standardize feature means and variances.
4️⃣ Model Training
Trained a LinearRegression model on the standardized training data.
5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Predicted sale prices on the test set.
Calculated:
R² Score
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Plotted predicted vs. actual values with:
Perfect prediction reference line
Error bars

📈 Results Accuracy Score: ~ 64.948 on the test set

📊 Features

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling, etc.)

Visualization: The scatter plot of predicted vs. actual sale prices shows a decent fit. A perfect prediction line helps visualize prediction accuracy.

🔮 Future Improvements Feature Engineering: Add more relevant features.

Model Selection: Compare with advanced models like Ridge, Lasso, or Random Forest.
